And ladies and gentleman, presenting the recipe for cookies

Ingredients:

    250 g Flour
    100 g Sugar
    1 tsp greated lemon peel 
    Vanilla Flavour or real Vanilla
    125 g fridge cold butter
    2 Egg Yolk
    1 tsp cream
    Baking Paper
    Clear Foil
    Cookie Molds

If you want to decorate:

    Apricot Jelly
    Icing Sugar
    Food Colour and Brush

1. Mix Flour, Sugar, Lemon Peel and Vanilla Flavour. Chopp Butter into small pieces and add as well with the two Egg Yolks. Mix well. Knead a firm dough as quickly as possible. The butter mustn't become warm. Best is to first use kneading hooks to mix the ingredients well and only in the end quickly press it to a firm dough with the hands. Cover with foil and put it in the fridge for minimum 2 hrs.

2. Preheat oven to 175Â°C. Prepare baking tray with baking paper.

3. Remove dough from the fridge and give it a quick knead with a tiny bit of cream until you get a smooth firm ball. Dust working surface with flour and roll the dough to 3mm thickness. Cut cookies, transfer to baking tray and bake for 8 to 10 minutes.

Decorate:

4. For decorating first heat the apricot Jelly and brush the upside of the still warm cookies with it. Mix Icing Sugar and small amount of water to thick but brushable consitency. Add food colour if you wish. You might have to add more Icing Sugar if it turned out to thin. Apply to the cookies and let them dry for a few hours. 

Tips:

You can also apply sugar beads, chocolate chips or any kind of edible decoration while the Icing Sugar is still wet. 

The color intensity will be better if two layers are applied. 

For cleaner colour results you can first trace the desired shape with a baking nozzle, let it dry a bit, and then fill in the free space.
